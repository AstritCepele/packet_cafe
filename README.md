# Packet Caf√©

## Background
Large open domain-specific datasets have proven to achieve new analytical abilities in their respective fields using machine learning. Now is the time to move that needle forward for cybersecurity. To do this, this project has two primary goals:
1.	Build a platform for easy-to-use automated network traffic analysis.
2.	Grow a sizable labeled dataset of network traffic data using that platform to push machine learning forward in the cybersecurity domain.

## Platform Architecture

## Get up and running

If you want to override the path location (for example only some paths can be mounted in OSX):
```
export VOL_PREFIX=/Users/me/packet_cafe_data
```

Using docker-compose:
```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

Using kubernetes (assuming your default orchestrator is set to k8s for stacks):
```
docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml packet_cafe
```

## Getting Started

The load balancer will process requests for both the UI (frontend) and the WEB (API) containers. It is exposed on port 80 by default. Requests that prepend `/api` to the URL will route requests to the WEB container and all other URLs will be routed to the UI container.  Additionally there is an ADMIN container that is exposed on its own port (5001) and is not load balanced.

Here are the following endpoints:

ADMIN (port 5001):
```
/v1                enumerates the endpoints for this service
/v1/id/files       returns all files that have been uploaded or created from those uploads
/v1/id/results     returns all files that have been created as an output from uploaded files
/v1/ids            return all of the IDs that have been created
/v1/info           returns basic information about the service, such as version
/v1/logs/{req_id}  returns the logs for a given ID
```

WEB (port 80):
```
/api/v1                                                 enumerates the endpoints for this service
/api/v1/id/{req_id}/{tool}/{pcap}/{counter}/{filename}  returns a results file for rendering
/api/v1/info                                            returns basic information about the service, such as version
/api/v1/results/{tool}/{counter}/{req_id}               returns the results from a tool for rendering
/api/v1/status/{req_id}                                 returns the status of an ID
/api/v1/stop/{req_id}                                   stops jobs of an ID
/api/v1/tools                                           returns list of available tools
/api/v1/upload                                          writes uploaded files to disk
```

UI (port 80):
```
/                                            main home page
/express-upload                              processing uploading a file
/id/{req_id}/{tool}/{pcap}/{counter}/{file}  renders a results file
/results/{req_id}/{tool}                     renders results from a tool
/*                                           redirects to main home page
```

## Testing POST requests with curl and datamash

```
time for i in {1..5};do curl -s -w "%{time_total}\n" -o /dev/null -X POST -F 'file=@merged.pcap' -L http://0.0.0.0/express-upload; done | datamash max 1 min 1 mean 1 median 1
```

## Testing using ApacheBench

```
ab -n 100 -c 10 http://0.0.0.0/api/v1/
```

Results should look something like the following:
